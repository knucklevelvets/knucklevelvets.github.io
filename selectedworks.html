                    <p>It's strange to think that this is probably on the living room floor. I didn't know when I started it it would come together so literally, attaching the fishing line. The three of us who did track connected by the braided shoelace. The white ribbon mirroring a white ribbon my friend and I did a dance duet with. Red ribbon that fell of a hat we wore for a performance. Cut out clouds of the school newspaper and stained them with watercolor. I used a boxcutter to cut the foam core, and I remember waking up at 4 am to sit in my basement and just chip away at it. I like to think I chose the medium to fit each person.</p>

                    <p>This piece was an impulse. Longing, perhaps, from scrolling through old photos on my phone of a time I'm sure was happier, but I'm not sure if I'd go back. Thinking of one of the most important people in my life, again and again. Counting down the days until his birthday. I wanted so badly to physicalize everything I felt, the love I felt for him like a physical blow to the chest. The act of chipping away the pastels with screwdriver was important to me -- to unpeel, scrape back the layers for the thing underneath. Same with the fishing line, these things brought together by thin wisps of string. I don't know how much to say but if you ever see this: it belongs to you, waiting in my living room for the day it hangs on a wall of yours.</p>

                    <p>I got my high school diploma wearing this hat. Sometimes an innocuous red-bricked building is a thing with teeth waiting to close its jaws. I remember the oil pastels smearing so prettily against the paper. Maybe it was the summer heat that made them softer, maybe it was my hands. I needed to kiss death on the lips and tell her no. I needed to be a ghost and yet alive all at once. This piece is entirely inspired by "I Know the End" by Phoebe Bridgers, which I was listening to quite often on my discman at the time. I like the outro and then the screams at the end, the apocalyptic guitar. I think maybe, just maybe, I needed that with me at my graduation.</p>

                    <p>Two sides of one piece of cardboard. And really I needed someone to understand that these could both be at once. Intimacy and violence. Grappling with love-hate for art and life. Some version of you holding yourself, some version of you killing yourself and leaving your bones to rot. Stuck in this perpetual life-death. Cardboard scraps become a flower. Gouge out the cardboard backing to make something new, give the skeleton eyes. What is this endless rebirth? I needed to know how to keep going. The skeleton side had something else entirely at first, a shift in perspective, not quite drastic enough. So I painted it over. The thing reborn again. As Sylvia Plath said: &quot;I am, I am, I am.&quot;</p>

                    <p>I sliced the canvas of the body of the girl with her back toward us to get the strings through. I think so much violence went into this piece: the ripping apart of the printed materials to see the thing underneath, the canvas splitting under the blade, and the overwhelming need to depict something larger than I had the ability, words, images for. I tried, of course. You hug a thing, but really, you're sitting on your bed on your phone. Wishing for something real, but how unreal is the unreal, actually?</p>

                    <p>I am fascinated with the blurring of good and evil and the duality of both being present in one person. I am obsessed with dualities in general. And this artist posted some YouTube video, sometimes bathed in a white cap with a wedding veil, other times a dark cap. A smashed pansy against his face. I wish I could explain why the mingling of beauty, tenderness and violence, anger is so fascinating to me.</p>

                    <p>I was listening to <em>End Transmission</em> by Snapcase, and the last song on that album is called "ID / Hindsight." I think I went a little insane the first time I heard it, the guitar and the drums swelling. The scream-singing begging. The crescendo. Music is so powerful, words that are not nearly adequate enough to explain the experience of this song. But then again, maybe neither are the visuals.</p>

                    <p>For a magazine I joined my first semester of college. They wanted to focus on iterations and the small details. I drink too much coffee, navy blue Keurig & Peets pods the sound of my mornings. I walk past this green bridge every day, too many days. It drives me crazy, the nets pointing your vision downward. I saw the spiderwebs hanging from it once in the summer light and wondered what it must be like, that sort of freeing suspension by a delicate string. In pictures, I love the view from the bridge, the foliage or the ice or the summer heat over the roaring water. Again and again and again I walk over that bridge. And the moon, my body my lover. Staring at the moon on cold walks home, my beautiful chunk of space rock.</p>
